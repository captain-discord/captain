# Captain

Captain is my own personal take on a cross between GearBot and Rowboat. Of course, this bot is still in development and will be for a very long time.

**If you need support or wish to report a bug, please join my Discord server: https://discord.gg/EBFhZYY**

## Features

You didn't come here to listen to me chatter about the unimportant stuff, you want the feature list, well here it is:
- A web dashboard so that you don't have to restart to change a guild's config
- Ban, unban, softban, kick, mute, unmute and warn commands
- Temporary muting, banning and lockdowns
- Purge in the current channel, a different channel, from a user or by bots
- Mod logging for actions, infractions, message edits/deletes and member joins/leaves
- Auto role
- Anti spam, curse, ping-spam, invite and links
- Very high configurability
- Message archive to save sent messages
- Starboards
- Reaction roles
- Persistent roles
- Advanced control over who can use what commands
- Reminders
- Custom commands
- Roles for badges

## Planned features

Here's what you can look forward to by clicking the Watch button in the top right hand corner:
- Configurable strike system to punish users after x warnings
- Anti links
- Leveling

## Who can host this?

This isn't really the kind of thing your average Joe should be trying to run, especially if you have no clue about Python, Docker, Postgres or Redis. If you're one of those people but would really like an instance of Captain, join the Discord server below (or contact me) and I'll either give you my instance or help you set one up.
